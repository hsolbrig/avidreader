<div style="text-align: center; color: darkred"> <h1>Honey Badger Reader Don't Care</h1> </div>

**<span style="color: darkred">HBReader</span>** is a toolkit for those of us who are tired of having to use one idiom 
to open a file on a disk, a second to retrieve the same file from the web and yet another to deal with text in memory. 
**<span style="color: darkred">HBReader</span>** allows you to read:

* Files - both relative and absolute file names
* URLs - relative and absolute
* Text - data that has yet to be put in a file or has already been retrieved
* Open file-like things
